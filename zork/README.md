Interpretations:
    - When there is an unknown command, the output is "Invalid command"
    - I account for a nonexistant command parameter, but telling the user to include a parameter
    - I set item status as "none" by default
    - It appears that certain fields are never used, like item descriptions
    - Account for the user taking an invalid item by outputting "No such item in this room"
